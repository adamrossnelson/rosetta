# Rosetta Stone (Python, R, Stata)
## Introduction
This project provides applied crosswalks between Stata, R, and Python. 

This crosswalk aims to provide multiple similar projects in different environments.

Aside from being useful in practice as a crosswalk this project can be useful in teaching each language or in learning statistics.
